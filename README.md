# Project--R-20

<table>
  
**In this project We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository**.<br></br>
Data were extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes.<br></br>
**The data consists of 5 columns**:<br>

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
entropy of image (continuous)<br></br>
class (integer)<br></br>
Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.
