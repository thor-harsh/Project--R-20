# Project--R-20

<table>
  
**In this project We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository.**.<br></br>

Data were extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes.<br></br>
**The data consists of 5 columns**:<br>

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<br></br>
entropy of image (continuous)<br></br>
class (integer)<br></br>
We will predict class Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.<br></br>

**Here we make use of NeuralNet and RandomForest model to do this project.** <br></br>

**Additional Information**: <br>

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.  For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels.<br> 
Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
